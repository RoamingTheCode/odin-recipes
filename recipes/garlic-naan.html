    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This flavorful garlic naan is cooked on the stovetop, in a cast-iron skillet.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 cup water, room temperature</li>
      <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>3/4 cup whole milk, room temperature</li>
      <li>1/2 cup full-fat plain yogurt</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
      <li>Cooking oil, for the bowl</li>
      <li>1 stick melted unsalted butter</li>
      <li>Kosher salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a glass measuring cup, combine the yeast, sugar, and water and let
        sit for 10 minutes. In the meantime, mix the flour, baking soda, and
        baking powder in a large bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk together the yeast mixture, yogurt, and milk, and stir into the
        dry ingredients. Knead with your hands until the dough forms a smooth,
        soft ball, about 2 minutes. Place the dough in an oiled bowl and cover
        with plastic wrap. Leave at room temperature until doubled in size,
        about 2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the dough from the bowl and turn onto a well-floured surface.
        Knead it briefly and divide the dough into 12 equal portions. Roll it
        into 1/4-inch thick ovals, approximately 6 inches wide.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a cast-iron skillet over moderately high heat. Sprinkle each
        portion with minced garlic and press it into the dough. Brush the dough
        with melted butter and place in skillet. Cook for about one minute,
        until the dough puffs up. Flip, cover the pan, and cook for one more
        minute. Remove from the pan and brush both sides with butter and
        sprinkle with salt. Place in a towel-lined bowl until ready to serve.
      </li>
    </ol>

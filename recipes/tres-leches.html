    <h1>Christina's Tres Leches Cake</h1>

    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      I first made Tres Leches cake when my baby was still a baby and I was
      trying to find something yummy to make for my friend Ana for her birthday.
      I asked her what her favorite type of cake was.
    </p>

    <p><em>“Tres Leches,”</em> she said.</p>

    <p>
      <em>“Tres Leches?”</em> I said. <em>“Three milks?”</em> I’d passed high
      school Spanish. But I’d never heard of the cake.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ana went on to explain to me what Tres Leches Cake is: a light, airy
      sponge cake soaked with a mixture of three milks: evaporated milk,
      sweetened condensed milk, and heavy cream. Yes, you heard me. It’s
      absolutely to die for.
    </p>

    <p><em>To die for.</em></p>

    <p>
      Look at all of that sweet goodness. And here’s the magical part about this
      cake recipe: it's such that no matter how much time passes, it will never
      be soggy. It’s a sponge cake, and like a sponge, it’s designed to hold
      moisture without falling apart.
    </p>

    <p><em>It’s a dream.</em></p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <h4>For the cake:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 c. all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tsp. baking powder</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp. salt</li>
      <li>5 whole eggs</li>
      <li>1 c. sugar, divided</li>
      <li>1 tsp. vanilla</li>
      <li>1/3 c. milk</li>
      <li>1 can evaporated milk</li>
      <li>1 can sweetened, condensed milk</li>
      <li>1/4 c. heavy cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the icing</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pt. heavy cream, for whipping</li>
      <li>3 tbsp. sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 350˚. Spray a 9 x 13 inch pan liberally until coated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Separate eggs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat egg yolks with 3/4 cup sugar on high speed until yolks are pale
        yellow. Stir in milk and vanilla. Pour egg yolk mixture over the flour
        mixture and stir very gently until combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat egg whites on high speed until soft peaks form. With the mixer on,
        pour in remaining 1/4 cup sugar and beat until egg whites are stiff but
        not dry.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fold egg white mixture into the batter very gently until just combined.
        Pour into prepared pan and spread to even out the surface.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 35 to 45 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Turn
        cake out onto a rimmed platter and allow to cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine condensed milk, evaporated milk, and heavy cream in a small
        pitcher. When cake is cool, pierce the surface with a fork several
        times. Slowly drizzle all but about 1 cup of the milk mixture—try to get
        as much around the edges of the cake as you can.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow the cake to absorb the milk mixture for 30 minutes. To ice the
        cake, whip 1 pint heavy cream with 3 tablespoons of sugar until thick
        and spreadable.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread over the surface of the cake. Decorate cake with whole or chopped
        maraschino cherries. Cut into squares and serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
